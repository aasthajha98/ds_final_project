# An Analysis of Prejudiced Speech and Sports

## Description

As the influence of sports expands in society, we question if it also influences policy via a lens of prejudice. Preliminarily we study the effect of a specific team's success on prejudiced speech and identify flags for further research into political implications. In this research, we analyze how prejudice changes as the US Women's Team proceeds through four stages of the US FIFA Women's World Cup in 2023. Through sentiment analysis models hate comments and comments with high toxicity on YouTube videos are 1. identified at higher rates when the team loses and 2. lower rates as the team wins during the tournament.
